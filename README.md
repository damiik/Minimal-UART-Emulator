# Minimal-UART-Emulator
Emulate the Minimal UART CPU in real-time in under 250 lines of C++ code.

I write a cycle exact real-time emulator for a real CPU system in C++ in about 250 lines of code and explain things along the way as good as I can. I am sure there are bugs or improvements to find. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Watch my other video about the Minimal UART CPU and minimal 8-bit CPU design on my YouTube channel
